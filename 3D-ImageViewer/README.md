# 3D Image Viewr

# Overview
This was a project I did for my computer graphics class. In this class we behaved as the GPU, we wrote C++ code to display images. We started with 2D images, but the final project was to move to 3D. We did not include arbitrary rotation of the image, but we did include X and Y rotation. This project was written by me, we were given little pre-written code and were set free to design our code on our own. 

# Initial thoughts
Going into this class I was excited to get to know C++ better, because I thoroughly enjoyed programming in C. I was very confident going in, because of my strong background in C.

# Takeaways 
My big takeaways from this project were proper project structure, C++ experience, and makefile experience. Before this project I had never really written a large program separated into many files like in this one. It really opened my eyes to how nicely this organizes my code and cuts down on some of my debugging time. I also learned lots of the convenient additions that C++ makes to C. Objects and the inheritance they bring are amazing. They allow us to easily cut down on code reuse, creating a parent object with very general functions and abilities then specifying more specific functions in the children objects really helps with self documentation. Overall I am a huge fan of what C++ adds. Finally, makefiles are the best. They really streamline the compilation process, which can become a beast on these larger projects. I will definitely continue to leverage makefiles.
