This is a very simple IOT temperature sensor that runs on a raspberry pi. It will email a given email using AWS SES when the temperature is too hot or too cold.
I used prewritten libraries for the I2C interface, and board initalization. I wrote the logic for grabbing the temperature and sending the email.
